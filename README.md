### What Is Roblox Game Info Gather

Roblox game info gathers information from the Roblox logs file, which gets you information like IP, Join Snapshot Timer, and How much time is taken to initialize the schema. You can also add more information to get all you have to do is look at the Roblox logs file and modify the codes.

The codes are not very clean sorry for that; I was a bit lazy when I wrote it; I may make another version of this, cleaner and with more functions.
